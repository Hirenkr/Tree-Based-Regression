# Tree-Based-Regression
We seek to predict Sales using regression trees and related approaches, treating the response as a quantitative variable

### Steps
#### (a) Splitted the data set into a training set and a test set.
#### (b) Fitted a regression tree to the training set. Plot the tree, and interpret the results. Then computed the test MSE.
#### (c) Pruned the tree obtained in (b). Used cross validation to determine the optimal level of tree complexity. Plotted the pruned tree to interpret the results
#### (d) Used the Bagging approach to analyze the data. Explored three different values for hyper-parameters to document Test MSE, to determine the variables that are most important.
#### (e) Used Random Forest to analyze the data. Explored three different values for hyper-parameters to document Test MSE for determining the variables that are most important.
#### (d) Used the Boosting approach to analyze the data. Explored three different values for hyper-parameters to document Test MSE for determining the variables that are most important.
